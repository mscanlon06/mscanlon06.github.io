<h1>Maddison Scanlon</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> Hi, my name is Maddie Scanlon and I am from Oregon. I am currently a freshman at Gonzaga Univerity, pursuing a nursing degree in hopes to work in pediatrics. Specifically, I want to work as a labor and delivery nurse. Some of my hobbies/interests include reading, baking, exploring new restaurants with my family, and spending time with my friends. I also enjoy swimming and playing Water Polo.</p>

<h3> Travel Blog!</h3>

Traveling is a big part of my life and I thought my page wouldn't be complete without sharing something that really matters to me!
<br>
<br>
 In 2018, my family flew across the country to support my uncle. For context, my uncle works for the national forest service and every year a different state is picked to deliver a tree to Washington DC for the National Tree Lighting Ceremony. While I was there I got to visit some museums, try new food, and spend quality time with my family. 
 <br>
 <br>
 During Covid (2020), I went to visit family in Bellingham, Washington. Since they only live ten minutes from the boarder of Canada, my parents insisted that we go to the Capilano Suspention Bridge in North Vancouver. I would say for a short trip it was pretty fun, although since I didn't know much about Canada at the time, I was surprised that a lot of people were speaking French. If I get the chance to go back, I would want to make the trip longer, and explore other places. 
<br>
<br>
In 2024, I was given the opportunity to go fly to Europe for one week and travel four different countries: France, Spain, Italy, and Monaco. Below I have included some photos of the cities I explored during my time abroad. First we have Nice, France. I have always wanted to go to France and after taking AP French in high school, this was my time to shine. I got to practice my French in restraunts, public transport, and local shops. Next, is Cinque Terre, Italy - my favorite of the four. I was absolutely obsessed with the collection of 5 towns that were only accessable by a high speed train. It was very calming and incredibly beautiful. To the right of Italy is Barcelona, Spain. I was able to get the chance to see La Sagrada Família, the Park Gũell, and much more. Lastly, I was able to explore one of the smallest countries on Earth; Monaco, the richest country in the world. You wouldn't believe the amount of yachts and luxury cars I saw.
